# Leetcode

A list of all problems I've solved from the popular coding-challenge platform [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/). Each problem has detailed documentation, explaining how I came to the solution, and its time complexity.

My goal is to complete one Leetcode problem a day. In order to practice using different languages, I'm challenging myself to pick one language for the next 10 problems. For example, problems 1-10 will be solved using C++, and problems 11-20 will be solved using Python. 

I'll be adding sections to this ```README``` to organize problems by which language they were solved in.
